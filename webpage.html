    ><b> About Me </b></h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Derin, and I'm from Indonesia. I'm currently 19 years old and studying Design at Taylor's University. Among my friends, I'm known for being a bit of a klutz and they often tease me about it. I take it all in good stride and even find it endearing when they tease me about it.</p>
<p>For me, having close relationships and spending quality time with loved ones is more important than having many acquaintances. While I do have a tendency to overthink things,I always try to maintain a positive outlook on life and remain optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Right now I am especially interested in studying animation, so naturally I plan to specialize in Digital Animation. With my passion for animation, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and what I can contribute to this awesome industry.</p>
